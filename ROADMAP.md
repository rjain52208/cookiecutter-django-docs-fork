# Roadmap (cookiecutter-django-docs-fork)

This roadmap tracks documentation and structure plans for this fork.

## Short Term
- Add "first deploy" checklist (environment variables, secrets, Docker basics).
- Add section in README for monitoring options (health checks, logs, metrics).
- Publish docs-only v0.1.0 release.

## Medium Term
- Write minimal deployment guide (Render, Railway, AWS).
- Include architecture diagram image in README.

## Long Term
- Create an example repo demonstrating usage of this template.
- Periodically sync with upstream Cookiecutter-Django to stay current.
